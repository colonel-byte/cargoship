# Markdown line formatting

## Do not hard-wrap lines in Markdown documents

Markdown files should NOT have hard-wrapped or truncated lines. Instead, write full paragraphs and list items on single, continuous lines without manual line breaks, letting editors and renderers handle line wrapping dynamically.

- Write entire paragraphs or list items on a single line without manual line breaks / hard wraps.
- Let editors and rendering tools handle line wrapping dynamically.

## Pad table cells so the columns line up

Tables are written in their aligned form, so that the source reads as a table and a reviewer can see the columns without rendering the file. Pad every cell with spaces to the width of the widest cell in its column, keep one space of padding inside each pipe, and run the dashes of the delimiter row out to that same width. Every line of the table then has the same length.

Write this:

```markdown
| Path                                   | What it holds     |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `.spec.config.registries[N].auth.user` | Registry username |
```

Not this:

```markdown
| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `.spec.config.registries[N].auth.user` | Registry username |
```
